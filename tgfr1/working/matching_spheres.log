There are 24 ligand heavy atoms
Ligand center of coords (x y z): 15.361625 66.780125 5.35808333333333
Using crystallographic ligand as spheres for output
Starting number of spheres from sph/sph cluster 0: 1173
FINISHED READING IN FILE sph/sph CLUSTER 0 
Number of sphere points after cutting off spheres too far from center of ligand (10 angstroms): 613
Number of spheres after removing too far (>7 angstroms) and too close to receptor (<1.2 angstroms): 613
Number of spheres polar: 131, nonpolar: 355, out of current total: 613
Extents of grid to search are X1 X2 Y1 Y2 Z1 Z2: 5.58101 25.32815 56.83669 76.77436 -4.59839 15.29605
Number of spheres after removing spheres too close to each other (approximately <1.5 angstroms): 208
Number of spheres after second pass removing spheres absolutely <0.8 from each other: 158
Crystallographic spheres are present, so doing continuity based on crystallographic spheres
After continuity checking, number of spheres is: 128
Spheres center of coords (x y z): 18.49567078125 67.9424578125 7.060041640625
Crystallographic ligand, so keeping spheres closest to ANY ligand atom, center of ligand (1/8), and center of spheres (1/8)
Average weighted-distance for final elimination is: 4.49242426122884
Final number of output spheres is: 45
Number of polar spheres: 11
Number of nonpolar spheres: 30
Number of spheres that are near neither polar nor nonpolar receptor atoms: 4
Final number of spheres that are from crystallographic ligand: 24
