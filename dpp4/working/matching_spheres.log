There are 31 ligand heavy atoms
Ligand center of coords (x y z): -18.4480967741936 -5.489 60.0589677419355
Using crystallographic ligand as spheres for output
Starting number of spheres from sph/sph cluster 0: 1056
FINISHED READING IN FILE sph/sph CLUSTER 0 
Number of sphere points after cutting off spheres too far from center of ligand (10 angstroms): 745
Number of spheres after removing too far (>7 angstroms) and too close to receptor (<1.2 angstroms): 733
Number of spheres polar: 196, nonpolar: 342, out of current total: 733
