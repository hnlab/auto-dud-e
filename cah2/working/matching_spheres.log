There are 8 ligand heavy atoms
Ligand center of coords (x y z): -5.9115 1.38725 16.824
Using crystallographic ligand as spheres for output
Starting number of spheres from sph/sph cluster 0: 485
FINISHED READING IN FILE sph/sph CLUSTER 0 
Number of sphere points after cutting off spheres too far from center of ligand (10 angstroms): 349
Number of spheres after removing too far (>7 angstroms) and too close to receptor (<1.2 angstroms): 347
Number of spheres polar: 65, nonpolar: 206, out of current total: 347
