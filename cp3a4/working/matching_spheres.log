There are 50 ligand heavy atoms
Ligand center of coords (x y z): 36.68594 -15.69362 29.69054
Using crystallographic ligand as spheres for output
Starting number of spheres from sph/sph cluster 0: 1944
FINISHED READING IN FILE sph/sph CLUSTER 0 
Number of sphere points after cutting off spheres too far from center of ligand (10 angstroms): 992
Number of spheres after removing too far (>7 angstroms) and too close to receptor (<1.2 angstroms): 992
Number of spheres polar: 244, nonpolar: 590, out of current total: 992
