There are 32 ligand heavy atoms
Ligand center of coords (x y z): 47.705 7.32640625 31.547125
Using crystallographic ligand as spheres for output
Starting number of spheres from sph/sph cluster 0: 1334
FINISHED READING IN FILE sph/sph CLUSTER 0 
Number of sphere points after cutting off spheres too far from center of ligand (10 angstroms): 760
Number of spheres after removing too far (>7 angstroms) and too close to receptor (<1.2 angstroms): 760
Number of spheres polar: 93, nonpolar: 498, out of current total: 760
