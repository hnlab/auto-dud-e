There are 24 ligand heavy atoms
Ligand center of coords (x y z): 10.1530416666667 -27.0006666666667 -10.16825
Using crystallographic ligand as spheres for output
Starting number of spheres from sph/sph cluster 0: 1291
FINISHED READING IN FILE sph/sph CLUSTER 0 
Number of sphere points after cutting off spheres too far from center of ligand (10 angstroms): 872
Number of spheres after removing too far (>7 angstroms) and too close to receptor (<1.2 angstroms): 859
Number of spheres polar: 59, nonpolar: 497, out of current total: 859
Extents of grid to search are X1 X2 Y1 Y2 Z1 Z2: 0.18886 20.10138 -36.95691 -17.16525 -20.16317 -3.61318
Number of spheres after removing spheres too close to each other (approximately <1.5 angstroms): 275
