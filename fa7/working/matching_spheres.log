There are 40 ligand heavy atoms
Ligand center of coords (x y z): 10.397175 41.86925 31.866675
Using crystallographic ligand as spheres for output
Starting number of spheres from sph/sph cluster 0: 1403
FINISHED READING IN FILE sph/sph CLUSTER 0 
Number of sphere points after cutting off spheres too far from center of ligand (10 angstroms): 764
Number of spheres after removing too far (>7 angstroms) and too close to receptor (<1.2 angstroms): 761
Number of spheres polar: 130, nonpolar: 387, out of current total: 761
