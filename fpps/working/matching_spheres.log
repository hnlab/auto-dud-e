There are 16 ligand heavy atoms
Ligand center of coords (x y z): 15.1554375 33.514625 -8.3803125
Using crystallographic ligand as spheres for output
Starting number of spheres from sph/sph cluster 0: 1148
FINISHED READING IN FILE sph/sph CLUSTER 0 
Number of sphere points after cutting off spheres too far from center of ligand (10 angstroms): 617
Number of spheres after removing too far (>7 angstroms) and too close to receptor (<1.2 angstroms): 617
Number of spheres polar: 99, nonpolar: 248, out of current total: 617
