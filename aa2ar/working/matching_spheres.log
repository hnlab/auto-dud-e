There are 25 ligand heavy atoms
Ligand center of coords (x y z): -9.06364 -7.1446 55.8626
Using crystallographic ligand as spheres for output
Starting number of spheres from sph/sph cluster 0: 1289
FINISHED READING IN FILE sph/sph CLUSTER 0 
Number of sphere points after cutting off spheres too far from center of ligand (10 angstroms): 869
Number of spheres after removing too far (>7 angstroms) and too close to receptor (<1.2 angstroms): 869
Number of spheres polar: 173, nonpolar: 581, out of current total: 869
