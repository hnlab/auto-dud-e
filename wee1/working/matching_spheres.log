There are 34 ligand heavy atoms
Ligand center of coords (x y z): 4.29888235294118 54.0800294117647 24.4682352941176
Using crystallographic ligand as spheres for output
Starting number of spheres from sph/sph cluster 0: 1116
FINISHED READING IN FILE sph/sph CLUSTER 0 
Number of sphere points after cutting off spheres too far from center of ligand (10 angstroms): 701
Number of spheres after removing too far (>7 angstroms) and too close to receptor (<1.2 angstroms): 701
Number of spheres polar: 118, nonpolar: 400, out of current total: 701

Number of spheres after removing spheres too close to each other (approximately <1.5 angstroms): 258
Number of spheres after second pass removing spheres absolutely <0.8 from each other: 219
Crystallographic spheres are present, so doing continuity based on crystallographic spheres
After continuity checking, number of spheres is: 192
Spheres center of coords (x y z): 2.16179864583333 51.96049546875 22.673141875
Crystallographic ligand, so keeping spheres closest to ANY ligand atom, center of ligand (1/8), and center of spheres (1/8)

Final number of output spheres is: 45
Number of polar spheres: 8
Number of nonpolar spheres: 35
Number of spheres that are near neither polar nor nonpolar receptor atoms: 2
Final number of spheres that are from crystallographic ligand: 34
