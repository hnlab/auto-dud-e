Number of spheres after removing spheres too close to each other (approximately <1.5 angstroms): 223
Number of spheres after second pass removing spheres absolutely <0.8 from each other: 181
Crystallographic spheres are present, so doing continuity based on crystallographic spheres
After continuity checking, number of spheres is: 46

Crystallographic ligand, so keeping spheres closest to ANY ligand atom, center of ligand (1/8), and center of spheres (1/8)
Average weighted-distance for final elimination is: 1.70646304511966
WARNING: removing a crystallographic sphere since 46>45 max spheres are present
Final number of output spheres is: 45
Number of polar spheres: 8
Number of nonpolar spheres: 28
Number of spheres that are near neither polar nor nonpolar receptor atoms: 9
Final number of spheres that are from crystallographic ligand: 45
