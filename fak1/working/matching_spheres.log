There are 35 ligand heavy atoms
Ligand center of coords (x y z): 10.6105142857143 3.12185714285714 6.04491428571429
Using crystallographic ligand as spheres for output
Starting number of spheres from sph/sph cluster 0: 1279
FINISHED READING IN FILE sph/sph CLUSTER 0 
Number of sphere points after cutting off spheres too far from center of ligand (10 angstroms): 732
Number of spheres after removing too far (>7 angstroms) and too close to receptor (<1.2 angstroms): 732
Number of spheres polar: 187, nonpolar: 383, out of current total: 732

Number of spheres after removing spheres too close to each other (approximately <1.5 angstroms): 252
Number of spheres after second pass removing spheres absolutely <0.8 from each other: 209
Crystallographic spheres are present, so doing continuity based on crystallographic spheres
After continuity checking, number of spheres is: 200
Spheres center of coords (x y z): 8.77039065 0.38109745 4.138766
Crystallographic ligand, so keeping spheres closest to ANY ligand atom, center of ligand (1/8), and center of spheres (1/8)
